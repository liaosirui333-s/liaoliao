{"prompt":"Undated Sheet ->","completion":" The best thing would be to write down everything that happens from day to day. To keep a diary in order to understand. To neglect no nuances or little details, even if they seem unimportant, and above all to classify them. I must say how I see this table, the street, people, my packet of tobacco, since these are the things which have changed. I must fix the exact extent and nature of this change.\nFor example, there is a cardboard box which contains my bottle of ink. I ought to try to say how I saw it before and how I —* it now. Well, it’s a parallelepiped rectangle standing out against – that’s silly, there’s nothing I can say about it. That’s what I must avoid: I mustn’t put strangeness where there’s nothing. I think that is the danger of keeping a diary: you exaggerate everything, you are on the look-out, and you continually stretch the truth. On the other hand, it is certain that from one moment to the next – and precisely in connexion with this box or any other object – I may recapture this impression of the day before yesterday. I must always be prepared, or else it might slip through my fingers again. I must never —† anything but note down carefully and in the greatest detail everything that happens.\nNaturally I can no longer write anything definite about that business on Saturday and the day before yesterday – I am already too far away from it; all that I can say is that in neither case was there anything people would ordinarily call an event. On Saturday the children were playing ducks and drakes, and I wanted to throw a pebble into the sea like them. At that moment I stopped, dropped the pebble and walked away. I imagine I must have looked rather bewildered, because the children laughed behind my back.\nSo much for the exterior. What happened inside me didn’t leave any clear traces. There was something which I saw and which dis- gusted me, but I no longer know whether I was looking at the sea or at the pebble. It was a flat pebble, completely dry on one side, wet and muddy on the other. I held it by the edges, with my fingers wide apart to avoid getting them dirty.\nThe day before yesterday, it was much more complicated. There was also that series of coincidences and misunderstandings which I can’t explain to myself. But I’m not going to amuse myself by put- ting all that down on paper. Anyhow, it’s certain that I was frightened or experienced some other feeling of that sort. If only I knew what I was frightened of, I should already have made consid- erable progress.\nThe odd thing is that I am not at all prepared to consider myself insane, and indeed I can see quite clearly that I am not: all these changes concern objects. At least, that is what I’d like to be sure about. END"}
{"prompt":"19320129 ->","completion":" Something has happened to me: I can’t doubt that any more. It came as an illness does, not like an ordinary certainty, not like any- thing obvious. It installed itself cunningly, little by little; I felt a little strange, a little awkward, and that was all. Once it was estab- lished, it didn’t move any more, it lay low and I was able to persuade myself that there was nothing wrong with me, that it was a false alarm. And now it has started blossoming.\nI don’t think the profession of historian fits a man for psycho- logical analysis. In our work, we have to deal only with simple feelings to which we give generic names such as Ambition and Interest. Yet if I had an iota of self-knowledge, now is the time when I ought to use it.\nThere is something new, for example, about my hands, a certain way of picking up my pipe or my fork. Or else it is the fork which now has a certain way of getting itself picked up, I don’t know. Just now, when I was on the point of coming into my room, I stopped short because I felt in my hand a cold object which attracted my attention by means of a sort of personality. I opened my hand and looked: I was simply holding the doorknob. This morning, at the library, when the Autodidact* came to say good-morning to me, it took me ten seconds to recognize him. I saw an unknown face which was barely a face. And then there was his hand, like a fat maggot in my hand. I let go of it straight away and the arm fell back limply.\nIn the streets too there are a great many suspicious noises to be heard.\nSo a change has taken place in the course of these last few weeks. But where? It’s an abstract change which settles on nothing. Is it I who has changed? If it isn’t I, then it’s this room, this town, this nature; I must choose.\nI think it’s I who has changed: that’s the simplest solution, also the most unpleasant. But I have to admit that I am subject to these sud- den transformations. The thing is that I very rarely think; consequently a host of little metamorphoses accumulate in me without my noticing it, and then, one fine day, a positive revolution takes place. That is what has given my life this halting, incoherent aspect. When I left France, for example, there were a lot of people who said I had gone off on a sudden impulse. And when I returned unexpectedly after six years of travelling, they might well have spoken of a sudden impulse once more. I can see myself again with Mercier in the office of that French official who resigned last year after the Pétrou business. Mercier was going to Bengal with an archaeological expedition. I had always wanted to go to Bengal, and he urged me to go with him. At present, I wonder why. I imag- ine that he didn’t feel too sure of Portal and that he was counting on me to keep an eye on him. I could see no reason to refuse. And even if, at the time, I had guessed at that little scheme with regard to Portal, that would have been another reason for accepting enthu- siastically. Well, I was paralysed, I couldn’t say a word. I was staring at a little Khmer statuette on a card-table next to a telephone. I felt as if I were full of lymph or warm milk.\nWith an angelic patience which concealed a slight irritation, Mercier was saying to me:\n‘You see, I have to be certain from the official point of view. I know that you’ll end up by saying yes, so you might as well accept straight away.’\nHe has a reddish-black beard, heavily scented. At every move- ment of his head I got a whiff of perfume. And then, all of a sudden, I awoke from a sleep which had lasted six years. The statue struck me as stupid and unattractive and I felt that I was terribly bored. I couldn’t understand why I was in Indo- China. What was I doing there? Why was I talking to those people? Why was I dressed so oddly? My passion was dead. For years it had submerged me and swept me along; now I felt empty. But that wasn’t the worst of it: installed in front of me with a sort of indolence there was a voluminous, insipid idea. I don’t know exactly what it was, but it sickened me so much that I couldn’t look at it. All that was mixed up for me with the perfume of Mercier’s beard.\nI pulled myself together, convulsed with anger against him, and answered curtly:\n‘Thank you, but I think I’ve done enough travelling: I must go back to France now.’\nTwo days later I took the boat for Marseille.\nIf I am not mistaken, and if all the signs which are piling up are indications of a fresh upheaval in my life, well then, I am fright- ened. It isn’t that my life is rich or weighty or precious, but I’m afraid of what is going to be born and take hold of me and carry me off – I wonder where? Shall I have to go away again, leaving every- thing behind – my research, my book? Shall I awake in a few months, a few years, exhausted, disappointed, in the midst of fresh ruins? I should like to understand myself properly before it is too late. END"}
{"prompt":"19320203 ->","completion":" A little while ago, going down the hotel stairs, I heard Lucie, who, for the hundredth time, was complaining to the landlady, while polishing the steps. The proprietress spoke with difficulty, using short sentences, because she had not put in her false teeth; she was almost naked, in a pink dressing- gown and Turkish slippers. Lucie was dirty, as usual; from time to time she stopped rubbing and straightened up on her knees to look at the proprietress. She spoke without pausing, reasonably:\n\"I'd like it a hundred times better if he went with other women,\" she said, \"it wouldn't make the slightest difference to me, so long as it didn't do him any harm.\"\nShe was talking about her husband: at forty this swarthy little woman had offered herself and her savings to a handsome young man, a fitter in the Usines Lecointe. She has an unhappy home life. Her husband does not beat her, is not unfaithful to her, but he drinks, he comes home drunk every evening. He's burning his candle at both ends; in three months I have seen him turn yellow and melt away. Lucie thinks it is drink. I believe he is tubercular.\n\"You have to take the upper hand,\" Lucie said.\nIt gnaws at her, I'm sure of it, but slowly, patiently: she takes the upper hand, she is able neither to console herself nor abandon herself to her suffering. She thinks about it a little bit, a very little bit, now and again she passes it on. Especially when she is with people, because they console her and also because it comforts her a little to talk about it with poise, with an air of giving advice. When she is alone in the rooms I hear her humming to keep herself from thinking. But she is morose all day, suddenly weary and sullen.\n\"It's there,\" she says, touching her throat, \"it won't go down.\"\nShe suffers as a miser. She must be miserly with her pleasures, as well. I wonder if sometimes she doesn't wish she were free of this monotonous sorrow, of these mutterings which start as soon as she stops singing, if she doesn't wish to suffer once and for all, to drown herself in despair. In any case, it would be impossible for her: she is bound. END"}
{"prompt":"19320203 ->","completion":" \"M. de Rollebon was quite ugly. Queen Marie Antoinette called him her 'dear ape.' Yet he had all the ladies of the court, but not by clowning like Voisenon the baboon: but by a magnetism which carried his lovely victims to the worst excesses of passion. He intrigues, plays a fairly suspect role in the affair of the Queen's necklace and disappears in 1790, after having dealings with Mirabeau-Tonneau and Nerciat. He turns up again in Russia where he attempts to assassinate Paul I, and from there, he travels to the farthest countries; the Indies, China, Turkestan. He smuggles, plots, spies. In 1813 he returns to Paris. By 1816, he has become all-powerful: he is the sole confidant of the Duchess d'Angouleme. This capricious old woman, obsessed by horrible childhood memories, grows calm and smiles when she sees him. Through her, he works his will at court. In March 1820, he marries Mile de Roquelaure, a very beautiful girl of eighteen. M. de Rollebon is seventy; he is at the height of distinc- tion, at the apogee of his life. Seven months later, accused of treason, he is arrested, thrown into a cell, where he dies after five years of imprisonment, without ever being brought to trial.\" I re-read with melancholy this note of Germain Berger.1 It was by those few lines that I first knew M. de Rollebon. How attractive he seemed and how I loved him after these few words! It is for him, for this mannikin that I am here. When I came back from my trip I could just as well have settled down in Paris or Marseilles. But most of the documents concerning the Marquis' long stays in France are in the municipal library of Bouville. Rollebon was the Lord of the Manor of Marmommes. Before the war, you could still find one of his descendants in this little town, an architect named Rollebon- Campouyre', who, at his death in 1912, left an important legacy to the Bouville library: letters of the Marquis, the fragment of a journal, and all sorts of papers. I have not yet gone through it all.\nI am glad to have found these notes. I had not read them for ten years. My handwriting has changed, or so it seems to me; I used to write in a smaller hand. How I loved M. de Rollebon that year! I remember one evening—a Tuesday evening: I had worked all day in the Mazarine; I had just gathered, from his correspondence, of 1789-90, in what a magisterial way he duped Nerciat. It was dark, I was going down the Avenue du Maine and I bought some chestnuts at the corner of the Rue de la Gaite\\ Was I happy! I laughed all by myself thinking of the face Nerciat must have made when he came back from Germany. The face of the Marquis is like this ink: it has paled considerably since I have worked over it.\nIn the first place, starting from 1801, I understand nothing more about his conduct. It is not the lack of documents: letters, fragments of memoirs, secret reports, police records. On the contrary I have almost too many of them. What is lacking in all this testimony is firmness and consistency. They do not contradict each other, neither do they agree with each other; they do not seem to be about the same person. And yet other historians work from the same sources of information. How do they do it? Am I more scrupulous or less intelligent? In any case, the question leaves me completely cold. In truth, what am I looking for? I don't know. For a long time, Rollebon the man has interested me more than the book to be written. But now, the man . . . the man begins to bore me. It is the book which attracts me. I feel more and more need to write—in the same proportion as I grow old, you might say.\nEvidently it must be admitted that Rollebon took an active part in the assassination of Paul I, that he then accepted an extremely important espionage mission to the Orient from the Czar and constantly betrayed Alexander to the advantage of Napoleon. At the same time he was able to carry on an active correspondence with the Comte d'Artois and send him unimportant information in order to convince him of his fidelity: none of all that is improbable; Fouche, at the same time, was playing a comedy much more dangerous and complex. Perhaps the Marquis also carried on a rifle-supplying business with the Asiatic principalities for his own profit.\nWell, yes: he could have done all that, but it is not proved: I am beginning to believe that nothing can ever be proved. These are honest hypotheses which take the facts into account: but I sense so definitely that they come from me, and that they are simply a way of unifying my own knowledge. Not a glimmer comes from Rollebon's side. Slow, lazy, sulky, the facts adapt themselves to the rigour of the order I wish to give them; but it remains outside of them. I have the feeling of doing a work of pure imagination. And I am certain that the characters in a novel\nwould nave a more genuine appearance, or, in any case, would be more agreeable. END"}
{"prompt":"19320204 ->","completion":" I have worked two hours in the reading-room. I went down to the Cour des Hypotheques to\nsmoke a pipe. A square paved with pinkish bricks. The people of Bouville are proud of it because it dates from the eighteenth century. At the entrance to the Rue Chamade and the Rue Suspedard, old chains bar the way to vehicles. Women in black who come to exercise their dogs glide beneath the arcades, along the walls. They rarely come out into the full light, but they cast ingenue glances from the corner of\ntheir eyes, on the statue of Gustave Impetraz. They don't know the name of this bronze giant but they see clearly from his frock coat and top hat that he was someone from the beau-monde. He holds his hat in his left hand, placing his right on a stack of papers: it is a little as though their grandfather were there on the pedestal, cast in bronze. They do not need to look at him very long to understand that he thought as they do, exactly as they do, on all subjects. At the service of their obstinately narrow, small ideas he has placed the authority and immense erudition drawn from the papers crushed in his hand. The women in black feel soothed, they can go peacefully minding their own business, running their households, walking their dogs out: they no longer have the responsibility of standing up, for their Christian ideals the high ideals which they get from their fathers; a man of bronze has made himself their guardian.\nThe encyclopedia devotes a few lines to this personage; I read them last year. I had set the volume on the window ledge; I could see Impetraz' green skull through the pane. I discovered that he flourished around 1890. He was a school inspector. He painted and drew charming sketches and wrote three books: Popularity and the Ancient Greeks (1887), Rollins Pedagogy (1891) and a poetic Testament in 1899. He died in 1902, to the deep regret of his dependents and people of good taste.\nI lean against the front of the library. I suck out my pipe which threatens to go out. I see an old lady fearfully leaving the gallery of arcades, looking slyly and obstinately at Impetraz. She suddenly grows bolder, she crosses the courtyard as fast as her legs can carry her, stops for a moment in front of the statue, her jaws trembling. Then she leaves, black against the pink pavement, and disappears into a chink in the wall.\nThis place might have been gay, around 1800, with its pink bricks and houses. Now there is something dry and evil about it, a delicate touch of horror. It comes from that fellow up there on his pedestal. When they cast this scholar in bronze they also turned out a sorcerer.\nI look at Impetraz full in the face. He has no eyes, hardly any nose, and beard eaten away by that strange leprosy which sometimes descends, like an epidemic, on all the statues in one neighbourhood. He bows; on the left hand side near his heart his waistcoat is soiled with a light green stain. He looks. He does not live, but neither is he inanimate. A mute power emanates from him: like a wind driving me backwards: Impetraz would 28\nlike to chase me out of the Cour des Hypotheques. But I shall not leave before I finish this pipe.\nA great, gaunt shadow suddenly springs up behind me. I jump.\n\"Excuse me, Monsieur, I didn't mean to disturb you. I saw your lips moving. You were undoubtedly repeating passages from your book.\" He laughs. \"You were hunting Alexandrines.\"\nI look at the Self-Taught Man with stupor. But he seems surprised at my surprise:\n\"Should we not, Monsieur, carefully avoid Alexandrines in prose?\"\nI have been slightly lowered in his estimation. I ask him what he's doing here at this hour. He\nexplains that his boss has given him the day off and he came straight to the library; that he is not going to eat lunch, that he is going to read till closing time. I am not listening to him any more, but he must have strayed from his original subject because I suddenly hear:\n\". . . to have, as you, the good fortune of writing a book.\" I have to say something. \"Good fortune,\" I say, dubiously.\nHe mistakes the sense of my answer and rapidly corrects himself:\n\"Monsieur, I should have said: 'merit.'\" We go up the steps. I don't feel like working. Someone has left Eugenie Grandet on the table, the book is open at page 27. I pick it up, mechanically, and begin to read page 27, then page 28: I haven't the courage to begin at the beginning. The Self-Taught Man has gone quickly to the shelves along the wall; he brings back two books which he places on the table, looking like a dog who has found a bone. \"What are you reading?\"\nHe seems reluctant to tell me: he hesitates, rolls his great, roving eyes, then stiffly holds out the books. Peat-Mosses and Where to Find Them by Larbaletrier, and HiUrpadesa, or, Useful Instruction by Lastex. So? I don't know what's bothering him: the books are definitely decent. Out of conscience I thumb through Hitofadesa and see nothing but the highest types of sentiment. END"}

From time to time I raise my head a little and see the immense, stiff collar and the chicken-like neck coming out of it. His clothes are shabby but his shirt is dazzling white. He has just taken another book from the same shelf, I can make out the title upside-down: The Arrow of Caudebec, A Norman Chronicle by Mile Julie Lavergne. The Self-Taught Man's choice of reading always disconcerts me.\nSuddenly the names of the authors he last read come back to my mind: Lambert, Langlois, Larbaletrier, Lastex, Lavergne. It is a revelation; I have understood the Self-Taught Man's method; he teaches himself alphabetically.\nI study him with a sort of admiration. What will-power he must have to carry through, slowly, obstinately, a plan on such a vast scale. One day, seven years ago (he told me he had been a student for seven years) he came pompously into this reading-room. He scanned the innumerable books which lined the walls and he must have said, something like Rastignac, \"Science! It is up to us.\" Then he went and took the first book from the first shelf on the far right; he opened to the first page, with a feeling of respect and fear mixed with an unshakable decision. Today he has reached \"L\"-\"K\" after \"J,\" \"L\" after \"K.\" He has passed brutally from the study of coleopterae to the quantum theory, from a work on Tamerlaine to a Catholic pamphlet against Darwinism, he has never been disconcerted for an instant. He has read everything; he has stored up in his head most of what anyone knows about parthenogenesis, and half the arguments against vivisection. There is a universe behind and before him. And the day is approaching when closing the last book on the last shelf on the far left: he will say to himself, \"Now what?\"\nThis is his lunch time; innocently he eats a slice of bread and a bar of Gala Peter. His eyes are lowered and I can study at leisure his fine, curved lashes, like a woman's. When he breathes he gives off an aroma of old tobacco mixed with the sweet scent of chocolate. END"}

He was sitting at the end of a table in the back; he had set his book down in front of him but he was not reading. He was smiling at a seedy-looking student who often comes to the library. The student allowed himself to be looked at for a moment, then suddenly stuck his tongue out and made a horrible face. The Self-Taught Man blushed, hurriedly plunged his nose into his book and became absorbed by his reading.\nI have reconsidered my thoughts of yesterday. I was completely dry: it made no difference to me whether there had been no adventures. I was only curious to know whether there could never he any.\nThis is what I thought: for the most banal even to become an adventure, you must (and this is enough) begin to recount it. This is what fools people: a man is always a teller of tales, he lives surrounded by his stories and the stories of others, he sees everything that happens to him through them; and he tries to live his own life as if he were telling a story.\nBut you have to choose: live or tell. For example, when I was in Hamburg, with that Erna girl I didn't trust and who was afraid of me, I led a funny sort of life. But I was in the middle of it, I didn't think about it. And then one evening, in a little cafe in San Pauli, she left me to go to the ladies' room. I stayed alone, there was a phonograph playing \"Blue Skies.\" I began to tell myself what had happened since I landed. I told myself, \"The third evening, as I was going into a dance hall called ha Grotte Bleue, I noticed a large woman, half seas over. And that woman is the one I am waiting for now, listening to 'Blue Skies,' the woman who is going to come back and sit down at my right and put her arms around my neck.\" Then I felt violently that I was having an adventure. But Erna came back and sat down beside me, she wound her arms around my neck and I hated her without knowing why. I understand now: one had to begin living again and the adventure was fading out.\nNothing happens while you live. The scenery changes, people come in and go out, that's all. There are no beginnings. Days are tacked on to days without rhyme or reason, an interminable, monotonous addition. From time to time you make a semi-total: you say: I've been travelling for three years, I've been in Bouville for three years. Neither is there any end: you never leave a woman, a friend, a city in one go. And then everything looks alike: Shanghai, Moscow, Algiers, everything is the same after two weeks. There are moments—rarely—when you make a landmark, you realize that you're going with a woman, in some messy business. The time of a flash. After that, the procession starts again, you begin to add up hours and days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. April, May, June. 1924, 1925, 1926.\nThat's living. But everything changes when you tell about life; it's a change no one notices: the proof is that people talk about true stories. As if there could possibly be true stories; things happen one way and we tell about them in the opposite sense. You seem to start at the beginning: \"It was a fine autumn evening\nin 1922. I was a notary's clerk in Marommes.\" And in reality you have started at the end. It was there, invisible and present, it is the one which gives to words the pomp and value of a beginning. \"I was out\nwalking, I had left the town without realizing it, I was thinking about my money troubles.\" This sentence, taken simply for what it is, means that the man was absorbed, morose, a hundred leagues from an adventure, exactly in the mood to let things happen without noticing them. But the end is there, transforming everything. For us, the man is already the hero of the story. His moroseness, his money troubles are much more precious than ours, they are all gilded by the light of future passions. And the story goes on in the reverse: instants have stopped piling themselves in a lighthearted way one on top of the other, they are snapped up by the end of the story which draws them and each one of them in turn, draws out the preceding instant: \"It was night, the street was deserted.\" The phrase is cast out negligently, it seems superfluous; but we do not let ourselves be caught and we put it aside: this is a piece of information whose value we shall subsequently appreciate. And we feel that the hero has lived all the details of this night like annunciations, promises, or even that he lived only those that were promises, blind and deaf to all that did not herald adventure. We forget that the future was not yet there; the man was walking in a night without forethought, a night which offered him a choice of dull rich prizes, and he did not make his choice.\nI wanted the moments of my life to follow and order themselves like those of a life remembered. You might as well try and catch time by the tail. END"}

I write to bring certain circumstances to light. Beware of literature.\nI must follow the pen, without looking for words.\nAt heart, what disgusts me is having been so sublime last evening. When I was twenty I used to\nget drunk and then explain that I was a fellow in the style of Descartes. I knew I was inflating myself with heroism, but I let myself go, it pleased me. After that, the next morning I felt as sick as if I had awakened in a bed full of vomit. I never vomit when I'm drunk but that would really be better. Yesterday I didn't even have the excuse of drunkenness. I got excited like an imbecile. I must wash myself clean with abstract thoughts, transparent as water.\nThis feeling of adventure definitely does not come from events: I have proved it. It's rather the way in which the moments are linked together. I think this is what happens: you suddenly feel that time is passing, that each instant leads to another, this one to another one, and so on; that each instant is annihilated, and that it isn't worth while to hold it back, etc., etc. And then you attribute this property to events which appear to you in the instants; what belongs to the form you carry over to the content. You talk a lot about this amazing flow of time but you hardly see it. You see a woman, you think that one day she'll be\nold, only you don't see her grow old. But there are moments when you think you see her grow old and feel yourself growing old with her: this is the feeling of adventure.\nIf I remember correctly, they call that the irreversibility of time. The feeling of adventure would simply be that of the irreversibility of time. But why don't we always have it? Is it that time is not always irreversible? There are moments when you have the impression that you can do what you want, go forward or backward, that it has no importance; and then other times when you might say that the links have been tightened and, in that case, it's not a question of missing your turn because you could never start again.\nAnny made the most of time. When she was in Djibouti and I was in Aden, and I used to go and see her for twenty-four hours, she managed to multiply the misunderstandings between us until there were only exactly sixty minutes before I had to leave; sixty minutes, just long enough to make you feel the seconds passing one by one. I remember one of those terrible evenings. I was supposed to leave at midnight. We went to an open-air movie; we were desperate, she as much as I. Only she led the game. At eleven o'clock, at the beginning of the main picture, she took my hand and held it in hers without a word. I was flooded with a bitter joy and I understood, without having to look at my watch, that it was eleven o'clock. From that time on we began to feel the minutes passing. That time we were leaving each other for three months. At one moment they threw a completely blank image on the screen, the darkness lifted, and I saw Anny was crying. Then, at midnight, she let go of my hand, after pressing it violently; I got up and left without saying a word to her. That was a good job. END"}

I lost a month verifying his assertions. Finally, it came out that he\nhad made the daughter of one of his tenant farmers pregnant. Can it be that he is nothing more than a\nlow comedian?\nI feel full of ill-will towards this lying little fop; perhaps it is spite: I was quite pleased that he lied\nto others but I would have liked him to make an exception of me; I thought we were thick as thieves\nand that he would finally tell me the truth. He told me nothing, nothing at all; nothing more than he\ntold Alexander or Louis XVIII whom he duped. It matters a lot to me that Rollebon should have been\na good fellow. Undoubtedly a rascal: who isn't? But a big or little rascal?

And when he betrays his benefactors and friends, he turns back gravely to the events, and\ndraws a moral from them. He never thought he had the slightest right over others, any more than\nothers over him: he considered as unjustified and gratuitous the gifts life gave him. He attached\nhimself strongly to everything but detaches himself easily. He never wrote his own letters or his works\nhimself: but had them composed by the public scribe.\nBut if this is where it all leads me, I'd be better off writing a novel on the Marquis de Rollebon.\n11.00 p.m.\nI dined at the Rendezvous des Cheminots. The patronne was there and I had to kiss her, but it was\nmainly out of politeness. She disgusts me a little, she is too white and besides, she smells like a\nnewborn child. She pressed my head against her breast in a burst of passion: she thinks it is the right\nthing. I played distractedly with her sex under the cover; then my arm went to sleep. I thought about de\nRollebon: after all, why shouldn't I write a novel on his life? I let my arm run along the woman's thigh\nand suddenly saw a small garden with low, wide trees on which immense hairy leaves were hanging.\nAnts were running everywhere, centipedes and ringworm. There were even more horrible animals:\ntheir bodies were made from a slice of toast, the kind you put under roast pigeons; they walked\nsideways with legs like a crab. The larger leaves were black with beasts. Behind the cactus and the\nBarbary fig trees, the Velleda of the public park pointed a finger at her sex. \"This park smells of\nvomit,\" I shouted.\n\"I didn't want to wake you up,\" the woman said, \"but the sheet got folded under my back and\nbesides I have to go down and look after the customers from the Paris train.\" END"}

{"prompt":"19320222 ->","completion":" This morning I consulted the Railway Guide: assuming that she hasn't lied to me, the Dieppe train\nwill leave at 5.38. But maybe her man will be driving her. I wandered around Menil-montant all\nmorning, then the quays in the afternoon. A few steps, a few walls separate me from her. At 5:38 our\nconversation of yesterday will become a memory, the opulent woman whose lips brushed against my\nmouth will rejoin, in the past, the slim little girl of Meknes, of London. But nothing was past yet, since\nshe was still there, since it was still possible to see her again, to persuade her, to take her away with me\nforever. I did not feel alone yet.\nI wanted to stop thinking about Anny, because, imagining\nher body and her face so much, I had fallen into a state of extreme nervousness: my hands trembled\nand icy chills shook me. I began to look through the books on display at second-hand stalls, especially\nobscene ones because at least that occupies your mind.\nWhen the Gare d'Orsay clock struck five I was looking at the pictures in a book entitled The\nDoctor with the Whif. There was little variety: in most of them, a heavy bearded man was brandishing\na riding whip over monstrous naked rumps. As soon as I realized it was five o'clock, I threw the book\nback on the pile and jumped into a taxi which took me to the Gare Saint-Lazare.\nI walked around the platform for about twenty minutes, then I saw them. She was wearing a\nheavy fur coat which made her look like a lady. And a short veil. The man had on a camel's-hair coat.\nHe was tanned, still young, very big, very handsome. A foreigner, surely, but not English; possibly\nEgyptian. They got on the train without seeing me. They did not speak to each other. Then the man got\noff and bought newspapers. Anny had lowered the window of her compartment; she saw me. She\nlooked at me for a long time, without anger, with inexpressive eyes. Then the man got back into the\ncompartment and the train left. At that moment I clearly saw the restaurant in Piccadilly where we\nused to eat, before, then everything went blank. I walked. When I felt tired I came into this cafe and\nwent to sleep. The waiter has just wakened me and I am writing this while half-asleep.\nTomorrow I shall take the noon train back to Bouville. Two days there will be enough to pack my\nbags and straighten out my accounts at the bank. I think the Hotel Printania will want me to pay two\nweeks extra because I didn't give them notice. Then I have to return all the books I borrowed from the\nlibrary. In any case, I'll be back in Paris before the end of the week.\nWill I gain anything by the change? It is still a city: this one happens to be cut in two by a river,\nthe other one is by the sea, yet they look alike. One takes a piece of bare sterile earth and one rolls big\nhollow stones on to it. Odours are held captive in these stones, odours heavier than air. Sometimes\npeople throw them out of the windows into the streets and they stay there until the wind breaks them\napart. In clear weather, noises come in one end of the city and go out the other, after going through all\nthe walls; at other times, the noises whirl around inside these sun-baked, ice-split stones.\nI am afraid of cities. But you mustn't leave them. If you go too far you come up against the\nvegetation belt. Vegetation has crawled for miles towards the cities. It is waiting. Once the city is dead,\nthe vegetation will cover it, will climb over the stones, grip them, search them, make them burst with\nits long black pincers; it will blind the holes and let its green paws hang over everything. You must\nstay in the cities as long as they are alive, you must never penetrate alone this great mass of hair\nwaiting at the gates; you must let it undulate and crack all by itself. In the cities, if you know how to\ntake care of yourself, and choose the times when all the beasts are sleeping in their holes and digesting,\nbehind the heaps of organic debris, you rarely come across anything more than minerals, the least\nfrightening of all existants.\nI am going back to Bouville. The vegetation has only surrounded three sides of it. On the fourth\nside there is a great hole full of black water which moves all by itself. The wind whistles between the\nhouses. The odours stay less time there than anywhere: chased out to sea by the wind, they race along\nthe surface of the black water like playful mists. It rains. They let plants grow between the gratings.\nCastrated, domesticated, so fat that they are harmless. They have enormous, whitish leaves which hang\nlike ears. When you touch them it feels like cartilage, everything is fat and white in Bouville because\nof all the water that falls from the sky. I am going back to Bouville. How horrible!\nI wake up with a start. It is midnight. Anny left Paris six hours ago. The boat is already at sea.\nShe is sleeping in a cabin and, up on deck, the handsome bronze man is smoking cigarettes. END"}
{"prompt":"19320224 ->","completion":" Is that what freedom is? Below me, the gardens go limply down towards the city, and a house\nrises up from each garden. I see the ocean, heavy, motionless, I see Bouville. It is a lovely day.\nI am free: there is absolutely no more reason for living, all the ones I have tried have given way\nand I can't imagine any more of them. I am still fairly young, I still have enough strength to start again.\nBut do I have to start again? How much, in the strongest of my terrors, my disgusts, I had counted on\nAnny to save me I realized only now. My past is dead. The Marquis de Rollebon is dead, Anny came\nback only to take all hope away.\nI am alone in this white, garden-rimmed street. Alone and free. But this freedom is rather like death.\nToday my life is ending. By tomorrow I will have left this town which spreads out at my feet,\nwhere I have lived so long. It will be nothing more than a name, squat, bourgeois, quite French, a\nname in my memory, not as rich as the names of Florence or Bagdad. A time will come when I shall\nwonder: whatever could I have done all day long when I was in Bouville? Nothing will be left of this\nsunlight, this afternoon, not even a memory.\nMy whole life is behind me. I see it completely, I see its shape and the slow movements which\nhave brought me this far. There is little to say about it: a lost game, that's all. Three years ago I came\nsolemnly to Bouville. I had lost the first round. I wanted to play the second and I lost again: I lost the\nwhole game. At the same time, I learned that you always lose. Only the rascals think they win. Now I\nam going to be like Anny, I am going to outlive myself. Eat, sleep, sleep, eat. Exist slowly, softly, like\nthese trees, like a puddle of water, like the red bench in the streetcar.\nThe Nausea has given me a short breathing spell. But I know it will come back again: it is my\nnormal state. Only today my body is too exhausted to stand it. Invalids also have happy moments of\nweakness which take away the consciousness of their illness for a few hours. I am bored, that's all.\nFrom time to time I yawn so widely that tears roll down my cheek. It is a profound boredom,\nprofound, the profound heart of existence, the very matter I am made of. I do not neglect myself, quite\nthe contrary: this morning I took a bath and shaved. Only when I think back over those careful little\nactions, I cannot understand how I was able to make them: they are so vain. Habit, no doubt, made\nthem for me. They aren't dead, they keep on busying themselves, gently, insidiously weaving their\nwebs, they wash me, dry me, dress me, like nurses. Did they also lead me to this hill? I can't remember\nhow I came any more. Probably up the Escalier Dautry: did I really climb up its hundred and ten steps\none by one? What is perhaps more difficult to imagine is that I am soon going to climb down again.\nYet I know I am: in a moment I shall find myself at the bottom of the Coteau Vert, if I raise my head,\nsee in the distance the lighting windows of these houses which are so close now. In the distance.\nAbove my head; above my head; and this instant which I cannot leave, which locks me in and\nlimits me on every side, this instant I am made of will be no more than a confused dream.\nI watch the grey shimmerings of Bouville at my feet. In the sun they look like heaps of shells,\nscales, splinters of bone, and gravel. Lost in the midst of this debris, tiny glimmers of glass or mica\nintermittently throw off light flames. In an hour the ripples, trenches, and thin furrows which run\nbetween these shells will be streets, I shall walk in these streets, between these walls. These little black\nmen I can just make out in the Rue Boulibet—in an hour I shall be one of them.\nI feel so far away from them, on the top of this hill. It seems as though I belong to another species.\nThey come out of their offices after their day of work, they look at the houses and the squares with\nsatisfaction, they think it is their city, a good, solid, bourgeois city. They aren't afraid, they feel at\nhome. All they have ever seen is trained water running from taps, light which fills bulbs when you turn\non the switch, half-breed, bastard trees held up with crutches. They have proof, a hundred times a day,\nthat everything happens mechanically, that the world obeys fixed, unchangeable laws. In a vacuum all\nbodies fall at the same rate of speed, the public park is closed at 4 p.m. in winter, at 6 p.m. in summer,\nlead melts at 335 degrees centigrade, the last streetcar leaves the Hotel de Ville at 11.05 p.m. They are\npeaceful, a little morose, they think about Tomorrow, that is to say, simply, a new today; cities have\nonly one day at their disposal and every morning it comes back exactly the same. They scarcely doll it\nup a bit on Sundays. Idiots. It is repugnant to me to think that I am going to see their thick, selfsatisfied faces. They make laws, they write popular novels, they get married, they are fools enough to\nhave children. And all this time, great, vague nature has slipped into their city, it has infiltrated\neverywhere, in their house, in their office, in themselves. It doesn't move, it stays quietly and they are\nfull of it inside, they breathe it, and they don't see it, they imagine it to be outside, twenty miles from\nthe city. I see it, I see this nature ... I know that its obedience is idleness, I know it has no laws: what\nthey take for constancy is only habit and it can change tomorrow.\nWhat if something were to happen? What if something suddenly started throbbing? Then they\nwould notice it was there and they'd think their hearts were going to burst. Then what good would their\ndykes, bulwarks, power houses, furnaces and pile drivers be to them? It can happen any time, perhaps\nright now: the omens are present. For example, the father of a family might go out for a walk, and,\nacross the street, he'll see something like a red rag, blown towards him by the wind. And when the rag\nhas gotten close to him he'll see that it is a side of rotten meat, grimy with dust, dragging itself along \nby crawling, skipping, a piece of writhing flesh rolling in the gutter, spasmodically shooting out spurts\nof blood. Or a mother might look at her child's cheek and ask him: \"What's that—a pimple?\" and see\nthe flesh puff out a little, split, open, and at the bottom of the split an eye, a laughing eye might appear.\nOr they might feel things gently brushing against their bodies, like the caresses of reeds to swimmers\nin a river. And they will realize that their clothing has become living things. And someone else might\nfeel something scratching in his mouth. He goes to the mirror, opens his mouth: and his tongue is an\nenormous, live centipede, rubbing its legs together and scraping his palate. He'd like to spit it out, but\nthe centipede is a part of him and he will have to tear it out with his own hands. And a crowd of things\nwill appear for which people will have to find new names—stone-eye, great three-cornered arm, toecrutch, spider-jaw. And someone might be sleeping in his comfortable bed, in his quiet, warm room,\nand wake up naked on a bluish earth, in a forest of rustling birch trees, rising red and white towards the\nsky like the smokestacks of Jouxtebouville, with big bumps half-way out of the ground, hairy and\nbulbous like onions. And birds will fly around these birch trees and pick at them with their beaks and\nmake them bleed. Sperm will flow slowly, gently, from these wounds, sperm mixed with blood, warm\nand glassy with little bubbles. Or else nothing like that will happen, there will be no appreciable\nchange, but one morning people will open their blinds and be surprised by a sort of frightful sixth\nsense, brooding heavily over things and seeming to pause. Nothing more than that: but for the little\ntime it lasts, there will be hundreds of suicides. Yes! Let it change just a little, just to see, I don't ask\nfor anything better. Then you will see other people, suddenly plunged into solitude. Men all alone,\ncompletely alone with horrible monstrosities, will run through the streets, pass heavily in front of me,\ntheir eyes staring, fleeing their ills yet carrying them with them, open-mouthed, with their insecttongue flapping its wings. Then I'll burst out laughing even though my body may be covered with\nfilthy, infected scabs which blossom into flowers of flesh, violets, buttercups. I'll lean against a wall\nand when they go by\nI'll shout: \"What's the matter with your science? What have you done with your humanism? Where is\nyour dignity?\" I will not be afraid—or at least no more than now. Will it not still be existence,\nvariations on existence? All these eyes which will slowly devour a face—they will undoubtedly be too\nmuch, but no more so than the first two, Existence is what I am afraid of.\nEvening falls, the first lamps are lit in the city. My God! How natural the city looks despite all its\ngeometries, how crushed it looks in the evening. It's so ... so evident, from here; could I be the only\none to see it? Is there nowhere another Cassandra on the summit of a hill, watching a city engulfed in\nthe depths of nature? But what difference does it make? What could I tell her?\nMy body slowly turns eastward, oscillates a little and begins to walk. END"}
